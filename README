---SOURCE CODE---

All source is in the "src" directory.

In order to compile, simply run make in the "src" directory.
All files should compile and can be examined in Coq IDE.
We used Coq version 8.5pl2.

This directory is a git repository, so the commit logs can be examined
if one desires.

Here are the files that we added:
FEV_Definitions.v	Contains our function definitions, including
			feval, which is our functional implementation
			to perform one small-step semantics step.
FEV_Properties.v	Contains all of our added proofs.
FEV_Example.v		Contains an example evaluation with Pair objects.

---DOCUMENTS---

All documents are in the "Document" directory.

Here are the important documents:
