In order to compile, simply run make in the "src" directory.
All files should compile and can be examined in Coq IDE.

Here are the files that we added:
FEV_Definitions.v	Contains our function definitions, including
			feval, which is our functional implementation
			to perform one small-step semantics step.
FEV_Properties.v	Contains all of our added proofs.
FEV_Example.v		Contains an example evaluation with Pair objects.
